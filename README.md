# Movie-Analysis_Microsoft

## Summary
When venturing into new business territory, it is important to understand what options are most viable in order to make smart and efficient business decisions.   Reviewing the industry history can help lead us in the right direction.

With the help of data science, we can create analysis to help understand what types of films do best at the box office.
With the analysis we should be able to give solid answers to questions such as:
* Which genres gross the highest revenue amount?
* Which month is best for releasing movies?
  * Which genres bring in the most revenue during which time of year?
* Which genres are not widely produced but make a lot of revenue?
* Which genres release more titles into the box offices?
